# shaper-watch
The end goal we have is to generate an input for a CNC router to cut a beautiful wall watch, see end-goal.jpg
![end goal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyMeH/shaper-watch/master/end-goal.jpg =250x "the final goal")

To calculate the placement of holes and cut lines we have a Java application that generates a .svg.
See result.svg:
![result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyMeH/shaper-watch/master/result.svg "the output of the App")

Finally, the .svg file is passed to a Shaper Origin CNC to perform the cuts.
